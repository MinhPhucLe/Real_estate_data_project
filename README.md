# Real_estate_data_project
This project represents my GR1 endeavorâ€”a data processing initiative focused on real estate. Utilizing a Python and Airflow-based ETL pipeline, it systematically caters to users' data requirements. Automated daily data extraction from real estate websites, facilitated by Airflow, ensures a constant flow of updated information.

Upon user requests regarding specific real estate criteria (address, min price, max price, min area, max area), the system responds by delivering personalized updates via email. This seamless integration of Python and Airflow underscores the project's commitment to efficiently meeting user demands in the dynamic field of real estate data processing.
